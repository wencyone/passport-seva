MyPassportWirelessHacks
=======================

Hacks for the Western Digital My Passport Wireless network attached
storage device.

**Disclaimer: These hacks require you to turn on the ssh access into the
device and will void your warranty.**

In order to turn on SSH access, go into the web user interface for the device,
click on "Admin" and turn on SSH in the "Access" section. You will then
use your device's IP address to login using your favorite ssh or scp client.
