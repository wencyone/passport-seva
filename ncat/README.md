# Download the binary

If you just want to grab a binary, you will find them in the  [binary/](https://github.com/ksylvan/MyPassportWirelessHacks/tree/master/ncat/binary) subdirectory.
Do so at your own risk. It works for me, but I make no
guarantees that it won't harm your device.

The rest of this guide walks you through creating your own
cross-compiling toolchain and compiling netcat from source for your My
Passport Wireless device.

# Cross-compilng ncat for the My Passport Wireless

These are the exact steps I used to cross-compile netcat from
http://nmap.org/ncat/ for the My Passport Wireless network attached
storage device. My host system was a Fedora 20 Linux, but similar
steps will work for other distributions.

## Setup crosstool-ng:

    git clone git://crosstool-ng.org/crosstool-ng
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --enable-local

The configure step fails if you are missing pre-requisites. So at this point,
install whatever is missing. For my Fedora 20 system, I had to do:

    sudo yum install gperf
    sudo yum install flex

Then go back to the rest of the steps:

    ./configure --enable-local
    make
    ./ct-ng menuconfig

At this point, you have to match the crosstool-ng toolchain with your
My Passport Wireless device. I had gathered some information from my system:

    # cat /etc/os-release 
    NAME=Buildroot
    VERSION=2013.05-svn157-dirty
    ID=buildroot
    VERSION_ID=2013.05
    PRETTY_NAME="Buildroot 2013.05"
    
    # cat /proc/version 
    Linux version 3.2.0 (primax@primax-vm) (gcc version 4.7.3 20130226 (prerelease) (crosstool-NG linaro-1.13.1-4.7-2013.03-20130313 - Linaro GCC 2013.03) ) #1 Thu Oct 2 16:08:39 CST 2014
    
    # uname -a
    Linux Home2 3.2.0 #1 Thu Oct 2 16:08:39 CST 2014 armv7l GNU/Linux
    
    # file /bin/busybox 
    /bin/busybox: setuid ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.31, BuildID[sha1]=7508def24d66e7eaffa9853bd9e099fe0aa93d00, stripped

Based on that information, I set up my toolchain in the menuconfig as follows:

* Target options ---> Target Architecture ---> select arm
* Operating System ---> Target OS ---> select linux
* Linux kernel version ---> select 2.6.31.14
* C-library ---> C library ---> select eglibc
* C-library ---> eglibc version ---> select 2_15
* C-Compiler ---> select Show linaro versions and then
* C-Compiler ---> gcc version ---> select linaro-4.7-2014.01

After you do all the above, you can exit all the way out of menuconfig,
which will write your .config file.

I have included my .config file (as support/config) in this repository,
in case you have problems, but I make no guarantees that it will work
for you.

Then, continuing with the build:

    ./ct-ng build

if you get a message about LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then

    unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ./ct-ng build

This step will take a while. When it's finished, you will have a
directory ~/x-tools that contains your cross-compiling toolchain.

    $ ls ~/x-tools/
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi
    
    $ ls ~/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi
    
    $ ls ~/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi  bin  build.log.bz2  include  lib  libexec  share
    
    $ ls ~/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin/
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-addr2line     arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gprof
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ar            arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ld
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-as            arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ld.bfd
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-cc            arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ldd
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-c++filt       arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-nm
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-cpp           arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-objcopy
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ct-ng.config  arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-objdump
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-elfedit       arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-populate
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc           arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-ranlib
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.7.3     arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-readelf
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc-ar        arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-size
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc-nm        arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-strings
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc-ranlib    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-strip
    arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcov

As you can see, crosstool-ng creates some unwieldy file names.  So, I
wrote a shell script (included as support/x-tools-symlink). This
script creates a bin directory in ~/x-tools populated by symlinks that
point to the cross-compiling toolchain binaries:

    $ ./support/x-tools-symlink arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi
    Setting up bin directory.
    ln -s ../arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-addr2line addr2line

    ln -s ../arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-strip strip
    Done.

Now you can simply set your PATH to point to ~/x-tools/bin first,
which will use your cross-compiling toolchain binaries with the usual
names (like "gcc" and "ld"), obviating the need to modify configure scripts and Makefiles.
This comes in handy for configure scripts that don't have easy ways to support
cross-compilation toolchains.

## Alternative 1: Compiling ncat official sources

With our toolchain ready to use, we are now ready to compile ncat.

Grab the nmap sources:

    svn co https://svn.nmap.org/nmap
    cd nmap
    PATH=~/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin:$PATH
    ./configure --host=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi --with-pcap=null
    cd libpcap
    make
    cd ../ncat/
    make

Now you have a binary that will run on your My Passport Wireless!

    $ file ncat
    ncat: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.31, not stripped
    $ ls -l ncat
    -rwxrwxr-x. 1 ksylvan ksylvan 1191443 Oct 21 15:15 ncat

Let's make it smaller:

    $ arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-strip ncat
    $ file ncat
    ncat: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.31, stripped
    $ ls -l ncat
    -rwxrwxr-x. 1 ksylvan ksylvan 288332 Oct 21 15:20 ncat

Now you can copy this binary to your device and run it:

    # uname -a
    Linux Home2 3.2.0 #1 Thu Oct 2 16:08:39 CST 2014 armv7l GNU/Linux
    # ./ncat --version
    Ncat: Version 6.47SVN ( http://nmap.org/ncat )

## Alternative 2: Use the busybox applet

The busybox binary that comes with the My Passport Wireless device is missing the "netcat" functionality.
Theoretically, you could build a full busybox and replace that one, but that seems overly risky to me.
Instead, we will build a very tiny executable that just incorporates the "netcat" command.

    $ git clone git://busybox.net/busybox.git
    $ cd busybox
    $ PATH=~/x-tools/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi/bin:$PATH
    $ make allnoconfig

The "make allnoconfig" line makes an empty configuration (includes *no* commands). Next, we select just the
netcat module.

    $ make menuconfig

Now, select Networking Utilities ---> nc, then tab over to the Exit and get out of the menu config program.

    $ make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-

This will make busybox, and the size of the executable is *much* smaller than what we saw above:

    $ ls -l busybox
    -rwxrwxr-x. 1 ksylvan ksylvan 12132 Oct 20 19:24 busybox

Now, copy the file to your My Passport Wireless device and rename it to "nc". This version works like the
official nmap version of ncat for most simple operations and is about 20 times smaller!

# Tricks with ncat

I have a UVerse gateway at my home for internet connectivity. The
administrative interface is pretty limited, but it allows me to
port-forward specific ports to other devices in the network via its
Firewall->"NAT/Gaming" tab. Using this, I forwarded port 22 (ssh) to
my My Passport Wireless device.

Armed with the external WAN address of my uVerse gateway, represented
as AA.BB.CC.DD below, I can now do this sort of thing:

From my laptop:

     $ ncat --sh-exec "ssh root@AA.BB.CC.DD ./ncat 192.168.1.254 80" --keep-open -l 8080

This uses the ncat I copied over ("./ncat") to connect to
192.168.1.254:80 which is the local area network address of the web
interface for the uVerse gateway and makes it available on my laptop at localhost:8080.
The same command would work just fine if you replaced "./ncat" with "./nc" (using the smaller
busybox alternative).

Then I use a browser and connect to localhost:8080 and I can
administer the uVerse gateway.

In fact, using similar commands, I can access all sorts of internal resources:

Suppose I have a Linux box in my internal network at 192.168.2.2.

From my laptop, from an external address, I can do this:

    $ ncat --sh-exec "ssh root@AA.BB.CC.DD ./nc 192.168.2.2 22" --keep-open -l 1122

And then, I can use the -p option of ssh to login to that machine:

    $ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false -p 1122 root@localhost
    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:1122' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
